            <p>I’m a senior at SFSU and this is my second project as Team Lead. 
                I’m also working on a cross-platform multiplayer chess game for iOS and online. 
                I have a background in art and enjoy designing, drawing, painting, and sculpting. 
                While I’m attending SFSU for computer science, I’m also a certified sommelier and
                 work in the restaurant industry. When I’m not working, I love golfing, working out,
                  and wine tasting. Before working in the restaurant industry, I worked at 
                  golf courses to support my golfing habit and played on the De Anza golf team.
